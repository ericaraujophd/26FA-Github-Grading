"""
roster.py, the single authoritative list of students.
=====================================================

    username,first_name,last_name,email,section,github_id,role

    username    the institution's identifier (jsmith). Forms the repository
                name, so it is stable even if the student renames their
                GitHub account.
    github_id   the GitHub login. Blank until the student supplies it, and a
                student with a blank github_id cannot be invited or given a
                repository. `assign` says so by name.
    role        student (the default), test, grader, teacher or staff.

    role=test   accounts are distributed to and graded exactly like students,
                so an assignment can be tried end to end before anyone real
                sees it, and are EXCLUDED from class counts.
    role=grader accounts are never distributed to and never graded, but
                `access` gives them READ access to every student repository
                for an assignment, so a teaching assistant can clone the
                work without anyone mailing half a gigabyte around.
    role=teacher and role=staff rows belong on the list (it is the course's
                list of people) but are never distributed to or graded.

Every tool reads the roster through this module, because the day each tool
kept its own copy of the parsing was the day one of them created a repository
for the instructor.

This file holds names and email addresses. Keep the course folder in a
private repository.
