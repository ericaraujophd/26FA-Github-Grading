# {{course_title}} ({{course}})

This folder is the whole course as the `{{course}}` command sees it. Keep it in a
**private** repository: `roster/roster.csv` holds student names and email
addresses, and `answers/` holds solutions.

```

## The four-command semester

```bash
{{course}} new a04               # make the folders, choose auto or manual
{{course}} verify a04            # check it before anyone sees it
{{course}} template a04 --go     # starter -> GitHub template repository
{{course}} assign a04 --go       # one private repository per student
```

Then, when marks are wanted:

```bash
{{course}} marks a04 --as-of "2026-10-14T23:59:59-04:00"
{{course}} sheet a04
```

Nothing changes GitHub without `--go`. Run `{{course}}` on its own to see what
is out of step, and `{{course}} doctor` when something feels wrong.

## Working with a grader

Add a roster row with `role=grader` and their GitHub login, then:

```bash
{{course}} access a04 --go                    # read access to every student repository
{{course}} access a04 --share ~/for-grader    # the folder they run `collect` from
```

## Three things to know

1. **Nothing changes GitHub without `--go`.** Every other invocation is a preview.
2. **Never push a file students have edited.** `patch` refuses; let it.
3. **The green tick is not the grade.** `marks` and `sheet` are.

## Where to read more

The toolkit's `docs/` folder has the long versions: writing an assignment,
score versus complete, troubleshooting, and the runner infrastructure.
